# setup basics using apt

- apt_setup : run all apt dependencies

- we'll do an ```apt update```

- we'll do an ```apt upgrade```

- we'll do an ```apt install git```

- we'll do an ```apt install gh```

- we'll do an ```apt install curl```

- we'll do an ```apt install docker```

- we'll do an ```apt install docker-compose```

## run this command:

```apt_setup```

# docker_generator.rb

- create a docker image of a ruby app, upload to github and create a docker-compose.yaml file for it

-- generator_config.yaml contains the specifics of where to look and what to call the app and it's exposed port

--- we'll add more if needed
